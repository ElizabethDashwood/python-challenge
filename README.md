# python-challenge
Description: This is the Module 3 Homework Challenge for Python scripting

Getting started: This challenge has 2 projects called:
  1. PyBank using a starter code csv file called budget_data.csv
  2. PyPoll using a started code csv file called election data.csv

Installations required:
  These projects have been run in a Windows 11 GitBash environment, using Python 3.10.13 together with Visual Studio Code Version 1.87.2 as the editor

Executing Homework Challenge Requirements: 

Please see python-challenge/PyBank/main.py for the script which performs the following 2 steps:

**Step 1: Correctly Reads in the CSV**
For PyBank project, the main.py python script file under 'python-challenge/PyBank' runs the process of reading the csv file and storing the header row.
The output is as follows:

**When the script runs for the command line in python using the python main.py command, the output shows the csv header:**
$ python main.py
<_csv.reader object at 0x000001CD7C135EA0>
CSV Header: ['Date', 'Profit/Losses']

**Step 2: Correctly determines the number of records in the csv file using len() and list functions**
**When the script runs for the command line in python using the python main.py command, the output shows the total number of months**
Total: 86

**The output from the main.py file is a follows:**
$ python main.py
<_csv.reader object at 0x00000219D83B5E40>
CSV Header: ['Date', 'Profit/Losses']

Financial Analysis

----------------------------

Total Months: 86


NOTE: This PyBank homework challenge is not yet complete. I have scheduled a tutorial next week for assistance, in case I cannot complete the tasks by then. I am also using the Xpert learning.  I work full time, but am catching up on my homework as quickly as time permits. I would prefer to sumbit some homework than no homework.

Please see python-challenge/PyPoll/main.py for the script which performs the following 2 steps:

**Step 1: Correctly Reads in the CSV**
For PyPoll project, the main.py python script file under 'python-challenge/PyPoll' runs the process of reading the csv file and storing the header row.
The output is as follows:

**When the script runs for the command line in python using the python main.py command, the output shows the csv header:**
$ python main.py
<_csv.reader object at 0x0000028DF8725DE0>
CSV Header: ['Ballot ID', 'County', 'Candidate']

**Step 2: Correctly determines the number of records in the csv file using len() and list functions**
**When the script runs for the command line in python using the python main.py command, the output shows the total number of votes**
Total Votes: 369711

**The output from the main.py file is a follows:**

$ python main.py
<_csv.reader object at 0x0000028DF8725DE0>
CSV Header: ['Ballot ID', 'County', 'Candidate']
Total: 369711
